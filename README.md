## Introduction
The project is to dicover the correlation between the accuracy of prediction with using different main algorithms and the dataset.
This time, we use the dataset that contains qualities of wine, and predict the quality by using Linear Regression, Random Forrest, and RForestClassifier.

We followed the platform Kaggle provides, [wine quality prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ankitakumar/linear-regression-using-wine-quality-dataset), with using three different algorithms to learn about the correlation between type of dataset and algorithms.

## Steps
### Load DataðŸ’»
Import panda
(Experienced a tiny problem when reading the csv file. Every time we refresh it, the file we imported is gone. Solved by conncecting with google drive)
### Data Visualization
Data Visualization provides tremendous help for determining which algorithm we can use to predict the data.

Ex. we can find the correlation between each factor. If they all have strong connections, then Linear Regression might be a good choice.
